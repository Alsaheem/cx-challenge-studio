Dear Candidate,
Thank you for your continued interest with Cx Studio. The Engineer Role is a very important
position within Cx Studio and we are seeking an individual who not only has development
experience but also knowledge of best practices. For the next step in your interview
process, we’d ask that you participate in the following exercise.
Return the completed exercise no later than 5pm on Friday 8th of September, 2023. If you
have any questions, feel free to reach out to me.

Exercise – Going AWS Serverless
Build a CDK deployment that creates an API Gateway, S3 Bucket, Lambda and DynamoDB.
Build what you need to build.
The Use case is that you need to allow a user to upload a file to S3 using the API and then
insert the data in the file into a DynamoDB table. Show off. Make it interesting. Add what
you think you need to add that would make it secure/redundant/HA. Include a README.md
file that describes how we need to deploy it using CDK. Also note any challenges that you
may have had.
Bonus points:
- full CRUD API to access data that gets loaded into DynamoDB
- unit tests.
Please deliver all source code in the form of a git repo.

Sincerely,

Lorne Currie
Information Technology Manager
